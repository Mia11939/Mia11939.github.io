I am a dedicated Artificial Intelligence Master's student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), with an expected graduation date in June 2025. My academic journey began at Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU), where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Language Intelligence and Technology, graduating in the top 6% of my class. My academic achievements have been recognized with first-class scholarships at both institutions.

My academic focus is on 'Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning', with a particular interest in 'Speech Synthesis and Natural Language Processing'. I have honed my skills in AI algorithms and Python programming, and have a strong foundation in courses such as Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Big Data Calculation Methods,Speech Recognition and Synthesis.

My ultimate goal is to leverage my expertise in these areas to develop a conversational chatbot that exhibits both emotional and intellectual intelligence. I am currently researching Speech Synthesis (TTS) and Spoken Dialogue Systems as part of my Master's degree, which aligns with my future aspirations.
