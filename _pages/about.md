Hello! My name is Yayue Deng. I am a dedicated Artificial Intelligence Master's student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), with an expected graduation date in June 2025. 

<!-- I have honed my skills in AI algorithms and Python programming, and have a strong foundation in courses such as Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Big Data Calculation Methods,Speech Recognition and Synthesis. -->
<!-- My academic journey began at Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU), where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Language Intelligence and Technology, graduating in the top 6% of my class. My academic achievements have been recognized with first-class scholarships at both institutions. -->

My academic focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a particular interest in **Speech Synthesis and Natural Language Processing**. My ultimate goal is to leverage my expertise in these areas to develop a conversational chatbot that exhibits both emotional and intellectual intelligence. I am currently researching Speech Synthesis (TTS) and Spoken Dialogue Systems as part of my Master's degree, which aligns with my future aspirations.

In addition to this primary line of research, I am also interested in:

&nbsp; - Refinement of models in the field of financial economics, and the application of domain-specific language models. 

&nbsp; - Macroeconomics, Machine Learning, and Finance

You can also read more about my research experience and my background by [clicking](blog/) or [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N_iA1hoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

**My future plan is to pursue a doctoral degree. If you are interested in my field of research, please feel free to contact me at yayue.deng@bupt.edu.cn or Twitter!**
